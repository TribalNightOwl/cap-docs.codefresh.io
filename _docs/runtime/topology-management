As with Argo CD, CSDP allows you to add managed clusters without Argo CD installed in them. You can add any component to the managed cluster.


> Only admin users can add and managed clusters. 

Where can you see it?

Argo             CD allows management of clusters that don't have argocd installed on them.

Codefresh needs to allow the user to manage, add,remove,modify these clusters, set them up, manage credentials, and reflect the cluster information in applications
In the Runtimes page, Optology View tab.

### Add/register managed cluster to runtime

The Topology View displays a tree view of runtimes and the clusters in which they are installed. The host name of the runtime and the cluster are identical, and the cluster is identified as the local runtime cluster or as the in-cluster.
Both the runtime and cluster health status     
Use the CLI to add and register any managed cluster to a runtime.

**Before you begin**  

* Make sure your Git user token is valid and has the correct permissions

**How to**  

1. In the CSDP UI, go to the [**Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes) {:target="\_blank"} page.
1. Select the **Runtime Topology** tab.
1. Scroll to the runtime to which to add the managed cluster, and then select **+ Add**.

{:start="4"}
1. Define the parameters in the command, and then run the command:  
  `<runtime-name> add <managed-cluster> --context <kube-context>`  
  where:  
  * `<runtime-name>` is the runtime to which to register or add the cluster and is automatically populated.
  * `<managed-cluster>` is the FQDN of the cluster to register to the runtime.
  * `<kube-context>` is the kube context to communiciate with the managed cluster

  The new managed cluster is added to the topology for the runtime.

### Work with managed clusters 
Once you add and register a managed cluster to a runtime, CSDP reports health and sync status for all the components in the cluster, options to manage the . 

Health or sync errors in a runtime's managed cluster are flagged by the error notification in the toolbar and visually flagged in the Topology View through the error icon            for both the runtime and the cluster componentns. 
by at the If at least one cluster-component has a sync or health error, it is encircled in red with an error icon in the Topology View. Drill down displays the panel listing all the cluster components, and the options to manage them. 


1. In the CSDP UI, go to the [**Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes) {:target="\_blank"} page.
1. Select the **Runtime Topology** tab.
1. Scroll to the managed cluster and select it.

1. To manage the runtime, select the three dots and then do any of the following:
* List view to toggle to the list of runtimes
* Add Cluster to register another managed cluster.
* Update Runtime to upgrade the runtime to the latest version or install critical updates.
* Uninstall Runtime to uninstall the runtime

1. To manage a cluster-component, select the three dots and select Uninstall.
